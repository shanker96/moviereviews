## Project Overview:
As a part of my coursework, I developed a web application for movie reviews using the Spring Boot framework. The application had all three layers of architecture - service, controller, and repository - and utilized MongoDB as the database. The primary goal of the project was to develop a fast and responsive application that allowed users to search and browse movies, and add and view reviews.

## Technologies Used:

- Spring Boot
- MongoDB
- REST APIs

## Architecture:
The application followed the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern. The model layer was responsible for managing the data using MongoDB, while the view layer handled the presentation of the data. The controller layer acted as the mediator between the view and model layers and provided RESTful endpoints to the frontend for data exchange.

## Features:

- Users could search for movies by title or genre and view movie details, including the director, cast, release date, and ratings.
- Users could add reviews and ratings for movies, view reviews from other users, and sort reviews based on relevance, date, or rating.
- The application implemented REST APIs that allowed for seamless integration with other applications and services.

## Performance Optimization:
To ensure fast and seamless access to the application, I optimized the performance of the REST APIs by implementing efficient query mechanisms, caching frequently accessed data, and minimizing the use of network resources. As a result, the average response time for API calls was reduced to less than 100 milliseconds, enhancing the user experience and improving the overall performance of the application.

## Conclusion:
The movie review web application developed using Spring Boot and MongoDB was a successful project that demonstrated my proficiency in full-stack development and REST API implementation. The application's features and optimized performance make it a reliable and user-friendly platform for movie enthusiasts.
